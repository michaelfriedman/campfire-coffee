# Code Fellows: Code 201
## Campfire Coffee
### README.md

#### User Stores (MVP)
- As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript.
- As a user, I want coffee sales data represented in tables rather than lists.

#### Technical Requirements
- Good use of a constructor function; style and syntax are correctly implemented
- Duplicate code has been removed and DRY principles are evident
- Working on a non-master branch for the day, with regular commit history

#### User Stories (Stretch)
- As a developer, I will continue to work on design aspects of the public-facing page.
- As a developer, I will build a style guide to facilitate design work.
